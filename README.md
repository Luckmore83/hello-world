Practising the GitHub flow
--------------------------
I'm Daniel, a student at KYH studying to become a Front-End developer. Just started diving into HTML this week and on Friday we're tackling CSS. I'm looking forward to learning more about JavaScript since I haven't used that language yet.

Got a real good start in CSS, made a box where you select where you want to go by train, a ticket ordering box. It took several hours to get it how I wanted it
but I'm happy with the result. I aso did a sneak peek into JavaScript because I wanted to try making my own Mad Libs. Very confusing but managed to make it work
at last. I started a new repo for it so I can use it as a solo project.
